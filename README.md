# NetFlix-Clone
Netflix Clone is an frontend project which is made using HTML and CSS
Project Title: Educational Netflix Clone - HTML/CSS

Project Description:
The Educational Netflix Clone project is a GitHub repository designed exclusively for educational purposes. It serves as a valuable resource for developers to learn the process of building a Netflix-inspired user interface (UI) using HTML and CSS.

Description:
This project focuses on providing a step-by-step guide to recreate a simplified version of the Netflix website, allowing learners to gain hands-on experience in front-end web development. By following the project's instructions and code examples, developers can enhance their HTML and CSS skills while understanding the principles behind building responsive websites.

The main goal of this project is to provide an educational platform where developers can explore and practice the core concepts of HTML and CSS. By replicating key features of the Netflix UI, learners can dive into topics such as layout design, responsive web development, styling techniques, and more.

Please note that this project is not intended for commercial purposes or to serve as an actual Netflix clone for production use. Instead, it is solely dedicated to providing a learning environment where developers can sharpen their front-end development skills.

The project's codebase will be thoroughly documented to ensure clarity and comprehension. This documentation will include explanations of HTML and CSS components, along with relevant examples and resources. Learners will have the opportunity to understand each step of the implementation process and modify the code as they see fit.
